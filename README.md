# PhotoShare API - README

## Project Overview
This mini-project is a REST API built using FastAPI, designed for managing photos, comments, and ratings. The project uses SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to handle database interactions, and PostgreSQL as the database. The API allows users to upload photos, add comments, and rate photos. Additional features include advanced image transformations, searching for photos by tags and descriptions, and user avatar management.

	Additionally, the project includes user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only registered users can upload and manage their own photos and comments using JWT tokens. Alembic is used for database migrations, and Docker Compose simplifies the setup of dependencies. Other enhancements include rate limiting, email verification, avatar management through Cloudinary, and photo transformation features such as resizing, cropping, and rotating.
## Key Features
### Photo Management
- Upload photos with descriptions and tags.
- Advanced photo transformations (resizing, cropping, rotating, and applying effects).
- Search photos by:
  - Keywords in descriptions.
  - Tags.
  - Ratings.
  - Creation date range.
- Manage photo metadata (update descriptions, delete photos).

### Comment Management
- Add comments under photos.
- Edit or update comments by their authors.
- Moderators and administrators can delete inappropriate comments.

### Photo Rating
- Users can rate photos on a scale of 0–5.
- Ratings are averaged to calculate the overall photo score.
- Only authenticated users can rate photos, and self-rating is restricted.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - User authentication is implemented using hashed passwords and JWT tokens (access and refresh tokens).
  - Users are assigned one of the following roles:
  - **Regular User**: Can manage their own photos and comments.
  - **Moderator**: Can delete comments from any user.
  - **Administrator**: Full access to manage all photos, comments, and user roles.
  - Users can only manage their own content (photos and comments) unless they are moderators or administrators.
  - Registration ensures no duplicate emails.
  - Secure password storage using hashing (passwords are never stored in plain text).
- **Email Verification**:
  - Newly registered users must verify their email address to activate their accounts.
   - Verification emails are sent using FastAPI-Mail, which includes:
    - A personalized greeting with the user's name.
    - A secure verification link containing a JWT token.
  - The verification link is generated dynamically and directs the user to an endpoint where their email is confirmed.
  - Email templates are stored in the `templates` folder (e.g., `verify_email.html`) and can be customized to fit the application's needs.
  - If an error occurs during email sending, it is logged for debugging and troubleshooting.
  - The verification link and token have a limited validity period for security purposes (if implemented).
- **Rate Limiting**:
- Rate limiting is implemented to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse of the API.
  - Limits the number of requests a user can make within a specified time window.
  - Prevents overloading the server with excessive requests.
  - Returns an `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` status code when the limit is exceeded.
  - Customizable rate limits can be applied to specific API endpoints (e.g., limiting photo creation requests to 10 per minute).
  - Limits are enforced on the frequency of contact creation requests to prevent abuse.
  - **Technology Used:**
  - Rate limiting is implemented using **FastAPI-Limiter** and **Redis** as a backend for tracking request counts.
- **Setup:**
  - Redis is configured to handle request tracking for rate limiting.
  - The configuration allows for flexible and scalable enforcement of limits.
- **User Avatar Upload**:
- **Functionality**:
  - Users can upload and update their profile avatars via **Cloudinary**.
  - Avatars are securely stored and accessible via unique URLs provided by Cloudinary.

- **Key Features**:
  - Supports image formats such as **JPEG** and **PNG**.
  - Avatar URLs are saved in the database and linked to the user’s profile.
  - Users can replace their avatar at any time.

- **Workflow**:
  1. Users upload an avatar through a **POST** request to the `/api/users/avatar` endpoint.
  2. The API validates the image and uploads it to Cloudinary.
  3. The generated URL is stored in the database.
  
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
  - Enabled to allow secure API access from web-based clients.
- **Functionality**:
  - CORS is enabled to allow secure access to the API from web-based clients hosted on different domains.
  - It ensures that only authorized origins can interact with the API.

- **Key Features**:
  - Configured to allow requests from specific domains, such as `http://localhost:8000`.
  - Supports credentials for secure cross-origin requests.
  - Allows all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and headers required by the API.

- **Technology Used**:
  - Implemented using FastAPI's **CORSMiddleware**.

- **Example Workflow**:
  1. A client hosted on `http://localhost:8000` sends a request to the API.
  2. The API validates the origin of the request.
  3. If the origin is allowed, the API responds with the requested data.
  4. If the origin is not allowed, the API returns a `403 Forbidden` status.

    - A personalized greeting.
    - A link generated dynamically with a limited validity period.
  - Unverified accounts cannot access the API.
- **Example Workflow**:
  1. The user registers and receives a verification email.
  2. The user clicks the verification link, which directs them to the `/api/auth/confirmed_email/{token}` endpoint.
  3. The server validates the token and confirms the email.
  4. The user gains access to the API.
- **Example Responses**:
  - **Email Verified**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Email confirmed"
    }
    ```
  - **Verification Error**:
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "Verification error"
    }
    ```

- **Login and JWT Tokens**
  - **Functionality**:
  - Authenticates users by validating their email and password.
  - Issues secure tokens for authenticated users.
- **Key Features**:
  - Users provide their email and password to log in.
  - If credentials are invalid:
    - The server returns `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`.
  - Upon successful authentication:
    - The server generates and returns:
      - **Access Token**: Grants short-term access to protected resources.
      - **Refresh Token**: Allows renewing the access token without re-authenticating.
    - Tokens are securely signed and include expiration times.
- **Example Workflow**:
  1. The user sends a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login` with their credentials.
  2. The server validates the credentials and issues the tokens.
  3. The user includes the `access_token` in the headers for subsequent requests.
- **Example Responses**:
  - **Successful Login**:
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...",
      "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...",
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    ```
  - **Invalid Credentials**:
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "Invalid email or password"
    }
    ```

- **Access Restrictions**
 - **Functionality**:
  - Restricts users from accessing or modifying content that does not belong to them.
- **Key Features**:
  - Users can only access and modify their own contacts, photos, and other resources.
  - Role-based access control ensures:
    - Regular users can manage their content.
    - Moderators can manage user-generated content (e.g., delete inappropriate comments).
    - Administrators have full access to all content and management features.
  - All POST operations return `HTTP 201 Created` on success.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Tokens are validated on each request to ensure the user’s session is active.
  - Unauthorized actions return an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` or `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` status.
